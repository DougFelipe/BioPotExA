This script defines the layout for the "Features" page of the BioRemPP platform. 

The Features page provides an overview of the platform's capabilities, including:
- Platform Overview
- Key Features and Expected Results
- Data Table Integration
- Gene and Pathway Analysis
- Interactions Between Samples, Compounds, and Genes
- Advanced Analytical Tools
- Toxicity Predictions
- Support Section

The layout utilizes Dash components to organize and display information interactively.
Additionally, a left sidebar menu is integrated to allow quick navigation to each topic or subtopic.
The sidebar has been configured as a sticky menu that follows the user's scrolling.

    """
    Returns the layout for the BioRemPP Features page.

    The layout is structured into multiple sections:
    - Platform Overview
    - Key Features and Expected Results
    - Toxicity Predictions
    - Advanced Tools and Features
    - Support Section
    
    Each section provides an overview of specific functionalities, interactive data visualizations, 
    or support-related links.
    
    A left sidebar menu is included to navigate directly to each topic and subtopic.
    The sidebar is configured to be sticky, so it remains visible as the user scrolls.
    
    Returns:
    - dash.html.Div: A Div containing the entire layout for the Features page.
